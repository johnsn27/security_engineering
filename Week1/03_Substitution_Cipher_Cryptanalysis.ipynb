    "In the previous task, we got familiar with the simple shift cipher, a.k.a. Caesar cipher. We saw while it could be secure against pre-school kids (and you shouldn't even bet on that much), it was laughably insecure! The main culprit was its small key-space size (of just 26): it allowed an exhaustive search (a brute force attack) with pen and paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, one can argue, we didn't have to shift every alphabet by the same amount: if the idea is to replace (substitute) the letters of the plaintext, why not letting substitution to be free for each letter. This is the idea behind another historical cipher called **(Simple) Substitution Cipher**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, if in Caesar cipher, `A` was to be replaced by `F` (so shifting forward by 5), then it forced `B` to be replaced by `G`, `C` be replaced by `H`, and so on. In contrast, in substitution cipher, `A` can be replaced by `F`, then `B` can be replaced by any letter (of course, other than `F` -- **why?**) say `X`, then `C` can be replaced by any letter (other than `F` or `X` -- **why?**), and so on. The substitution mapping is the secret key, which should be known to both Alice and Bob, but no-one else. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we will see in this lab task, this cipher, although seems promising against Caesar, is still trivially insecure! However, interestingly, the reason is **NOT** because of a small key-space size. Enough said by me, the rest should be your thinking!\n",
