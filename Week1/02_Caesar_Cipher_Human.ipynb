    "Caesar Cipher is a a toy example of a *symmetric key* cryptosystem. The idea is very simple: Shift each letter of the plaintext by a secret value (forward if positive, backward if negative). This shift value is the secret \"key\". Hence, not surprisingly, Caesar cipher is also known as the *shift cipher*. Since plaintext units are simply replaced with a plaintext symbol, Caesar Cipher is an example of *substitution ciphers*. More specifically, since a fixed substitution is used for each alphabet letter of the plaintext, it is an example of a \"*mono-alphabetic*\" substitution cipher. \n",

    "- take each letter of the plaintext at a time;  \n",
    "- find its order number in the alphabet (A is 0, B is 1, ..., Z is 25);\n",
