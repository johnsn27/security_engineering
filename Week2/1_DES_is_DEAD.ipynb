    "# The Death of DES!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before AES, there was DES, the gold standard of yesteryear (1980s and 1990s). DES stands for *__D__ata __E__ncryption __S__tandard*, quite presumptive and ironic naming in retrospect, which raises the question, is the word \"Advanced\" Encryption System (AES) going to become a source of amusement in a not-so-distant future?! \n",
    "\n",
    "But joking aside, the death of DES came about primarily due NOT to an inherent weakness in its design (though some *better-than-brute-force* academic attacks were discovered later on) but rather because of its short key length! DES was developed by engi-scientists of IBM in close collaboration with the US's National Security Agency -- NSA (later turned out). NSA's involvement was allegedly a double-edge sword: it helped to strengthen DES against a class of mathematical attack techniques (called *differential cryptanalytic* attacks, later re-discovered), but at the same time, weakened the cipher against brute-force attacks, by (again, allegedly) convincing IBM to choose a shorter key length (with the excuse that the implementation can be done on a single chip)! In what follows, we examine DES a bit, and convince ourselves why **DES is dead**. \n",
